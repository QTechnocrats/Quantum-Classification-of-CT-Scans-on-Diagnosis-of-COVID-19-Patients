# Quantum-Classification-of-CT-Scans-on-Diagnosis-of-COVID-19-Patients

1. Classical Convolution to reduce data dimension
2. Quantum convolution to reduce data dimension
3. Single circuit as a whole model
4. two circuits - one is to differentiate if he has disease or not, if yes then 2nd model to differentiate covid or pneumonia
